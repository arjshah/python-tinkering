# Exploring Python 3.9
I'm new to programming in Python. Here's what I've learned thus far:
- The language is clean and easy to read.
- This is a questionable assertion, but upon first look Python requires fewer lines of code to accomplish the same task when compared to Java. 
- Separating out blocks of code into their own modules seems straightforward.
- Python interpreter is pretty quick. Feedback loops are quick.
- My git skills are quite rusty!

In this repository, I get into:

- Data structures - i.e. lists, dictionaries.
- Loops - i.e. for, while.
- Functions and modules.
- Classes and methods.
- Files - i.e. reading, manipulation.
- Exception handling.
- Django framework.

I plan to get into building more complex applications once I'm done here.
